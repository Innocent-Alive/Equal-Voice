        <h2>What Is Gender Equity ?</h2>
        <p class="leftside">Gender equity refers to the fair and impartial treatment of individuals, regardless of their gender, in all aspects of society. It involves ensuring that everyone has equal access to opportunities and benefits, irrespective of their gender identity. Gender equity recognizes that historical and social disadvantages have affected certain genders disproportionately and seeks to address these disparities.</p>

          <p class="rightside">Gender equity goes beyond simply treating men and women equally. It recognizes and respects the diverse identities and experiences of individuals beyond the binary understanding of gender. This includes transgender, non-binary, among others.</p>
          
        <p class="leftside">Achieving gender equity involves challenging and dismantling societal norms, stereotypes, and discriminatory practices that have perpetuated gender-based inequalities. It requires creating inclusive environments where everyone can participate fully and thrive, regardless of their gender expression.</p>
          
        <p class="rightside">Efforts towards gender equity encompass areas such as education, healthcare, employment, leadership roles, and access to resources and opportunities. By promoting gender equity, we work towards building a more just and inclusive society where all individuals can live free from discrimination and have the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>

                    <h3>Societal Expectations and Stereotypes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Traditional gender roles and expectations can limit men's freedom of expression and choices.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Cultural norms often reinforce expectations for men to be stoic, tough, and unemotional, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Stereotypes around masculinity can create pressure to conform to specific behaviors or interests, limiting individuality and self-expression.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Mental Health Stigma:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Societal stigma and stereotypes can discourage men from seeking help for mental health issues.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Men may face added pressure to appear strong and self-reliant, which can prevent them from openly discussing their emotions or seeking support when needed.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This can contribute to higher rates of undiagnosed mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Domestic and Parental Responsibilities:</h3>

                      <li>
                        Gender equity issues can also encompass challenges faced by men in balancing work, family, and caregiving responsibilities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Traditional gender norms may limit men's involvement in domestic chores and parenting, leading to unequal distribution of responsibilities and expectations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Men who desire to take an active role in caregiving or be stay-at-home fathers may face societal judgment or lack of support.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Education and Career Choices:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Men can experience gender-related pressures in education and career paths.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Certain fields, such as teaching or nursing, may carry societal stereotypes that discourage men from pursuing these professions.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Additionally, men may face gender bias when seeking flexible work arrangements or parental leave, impacting their work-life balance.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Violence and Abuse:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        While women are disproportionately affected by domestic violence and sexual assault, men can also be victims.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Male survivors may face additional challenges in seeking support or being taken seriously due to societal perceptions surrounding masculinity.

                    <h2>Concerns In India :</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Gender-Based Violence: </h3>Violence against women remains a critical concern in India. Incidents of domestic violence, sexual assault, harassment, and human trafficking continue to be prevalent, affecting women's safety and well-being.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Gender Pay Gap:</h3>Women in India often face wage disparities and are paid less than their male counterparts for similar work. This gender pay gap contributes to economic inequality and hinders women's financial independence.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Limited Access to Education:</h3>Although strides have been made, access to education for girls and women is still limited in some regions of India. Cultural norms, early marriages, and lack of educational infrastructure can hinder girls' education and development.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Lack of Women in Leadership Positions: </h3>Although strides have been made, access to education for girls and women is still limited in some regions of India. Cultural norms, early marriages, and lack of educational infrastructure can hinder girls' education and development.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Child Marriage: </h3>Child marriage is a significant concern, particularly in rural areas. Early marriage affects girls' education, health, and overall development, perpetuating gender disparities.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Female Infanticide and Sex-Selective Abortions:</h3>Discrimination against female children leads to practices such as female infanticide and sex-selective abortions, resulting in imbalanced sex ratios.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Gender Bias and Stereotyping:</h3>Deep-rooted gender biases and stereotypes persist in Indian society, influencing expectations, opportunities, and societal roles for men and women.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Lack of Access to Healthcare:</h3> Women's access to quality healthcare, especially in rural areas, is a matter of concern. Maternal mortality rates and other health indicators for women need improvement.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">Limited Economic Participation:</h3> Women's participation in the formal workforce is lower compared to men. Barriers such as lack of opportunities, mobility constraints, and societal expectations restrict women's economic empowerment.</li>
                      <li><h3 class="a45">LGBTQ+ Rights: </h3>The LGBTQ+ community faces discrimination and legal challenges, as same-sex relationships are not fully recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals often experience social stigmatization and exclusion.</li>

              <h2>India's Gender Gap: Why It's So Hard to Close</h2>
              <p>
                Across India gender inequality results in unequal opportunities, and while it impacts on the lives of both genders, statistically it is girls that are the most disadvantaged. Globally girls have higher survival rates at birth, are more likely to be developmentally on track, and just as likely to participate in preschool, Girls are also more likely to drop out of school.

              <p>
                A wise man of great intellect and power once said, "The best measure of a nation's progress is the way it treats its women". For centuries, women have faced challenges and hurdles and that has bestowed on them infinite patience, perseverance and have only helped them emerge stronger. At present, there are 432 million women of working-age in India, out of which 343 million are employed in the unorganized sector.
